# Hyper Mix Project Summary

## Overview
A WebGL particle animation experiment that renders an interactive 3D particle system with various post-processing effects. Built with THREE.js and modern WebGL techniques.

## Core Components

### Main Entry (src/index.js)
- Initializes THREE.js scene, renderer, and camera
- Sets up particle system and post-processing
- Manages animation loop and event handling
- Configures GUI controls

### Particle System (src/3d/particles.js)
- Particle geometry and materials management
- Rendering and update cycles
- Depth and motion blur integration
- Size and blending controls

### Simulation (src/3d/simulator.js)
- Texture-based position simulation
- Physics and movement calculations
- Particle lifetime management
- GPU-accelerated updates

### Post-Processing Effects
Located in `src/3d/postprocessing/`:
- Motion blur
- Depth of field
- Bloom effects
- FXAA anti-aliasing
- Vignette effects

### Camera Controls
`src/controls/OrbitControls.js`:
- Orbital rotation
- Zoom functionality
- Pan movements
- Multi-device input support
- Keyboard controls

## Build System
- Browserify (bundling)
- Glslify (shader compilation)
- Budo (development server)
- UglifyJS (minification)

## Key Features
1. GPU-accelerated particle simulation
2. Advanced post-processing pipeline
